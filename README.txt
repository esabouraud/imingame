	Tell your MSN friends what games you are playing.

IMinGame is based on Pier Castonguay's NowPlayingGames v1.13
(http://nowplayinggames.sytes.net/). It is released under a BSD licence.

Once run, IMinGame will start updating your MSN "Now Playing" (or "Show
what I'm listening to") status, with the name of the game you are playing.

It should work with other IM software implementing the 'Send "Now Playing"
information to MSN Messenger' interface, like Pidgin (http://www.pidgin.im)
with the musictracker plugin (http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker).

* Compatibility :
	Windows XP/Vista 32 bits
	DirectX/OpenGL games
	MSN / Live Messenger / Pidgin (with Musictracker)

* Requirements :
	Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)
	or
	Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 SP1 to build from source
