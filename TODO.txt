Maintenance : 
	* better handling of ini file to store settings
	* german and spanish language support

New features ideas :
	* add GTalk "Music Status" support (is it possible without plugin) ?
	* handle detection of non directx/opengl games (ex: popcap games)
	* update name of game some time after in launches
	* drag&drop to add application to whitelist
	* remove/increase limit on white/black list size
	* add option to display in-game time
	* add option to provide steam profile "join game" link (unlikely) ?
	* add option to disable exit confirmation message
	* launch on windows startup option in installer (but avoid unnecessary hooking)
	* right click menu on tray icon (quit, force update)
